# HIV-deathrate-prediction
HIV deathrate prediction by state-of the-art multivariate Gaidai reliability method

README

What the project does: introduces public health bio-risk assessment methodology, developed and successfully applied to HIV (i.e., Human Immunodeficiency Virus) recorded clinical death rates. 
Why the project is useful: Suggested Gaidai risk assessment methodology may be utilized in various public bio and public health clinical applications based on available raw patient survey datasets.
How users can get started with the project: Gaidai risk assessment methodology being generic and multivariate, hence supplied MATLAB source code can be utilized, only changing input dataset is required.
Where users can get help with your project: we provide extensive reference list, containing successful application examples of the multivariate Gaidai risk assessment methodology.
Who maintains and contributes to the project: Prof. Oleg Gaidai, Shanghai Ocean University, China.

How-to-use: having input ASCI one columt text file (in our case World_R.txt), just run main extrapolator MAIN.m (MATLAB format) to obtain multivariate system's risk (probability of exceeding given threshold on the decimal log scale).
